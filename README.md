  - Archived or deleted most of my stuff, kinda lost the desire to constantly try to update, maintain, or make new things. This doesn't necessarily mean I'm done, nor does it necessarily mean I'm stopping those projects, rather I won't be progressing as much as I used to. If they become unarchived it means I have begun working on them a bit.
