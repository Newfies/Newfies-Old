# Newfies
Hello, I Love Newfies!

## Updates
[ **March 21, 2024** ] - Archived or deleted most of my stuff, kinda lost the desire to constantly try to update, maintain or, make new things. This doesn't neccessarilly mean I'm done, nor does it neccessarilly mean I'm stopping those projects, rather I wont be progressing as much as I used to. If they become unarchived it means I have began working on that a bit.
